# APSSDC-CS-PROJECT

## Overview: 
This Python application demonstrates a basic keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes from a keyboard. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for easy control and monitoring of the keylogging process. The keylogger logs keystrokes to both text and JSON files, providing flexibility in data storage and analysis.

## Features:

--> Real-time capturing and logging of keystrokes.
--> User-friendly GUI with start and stop buttons.
--> Dual logging formats: saves keystrokes to text and JSON files.
--> Cross-platform compatibility: works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Usage:
# Installation:

--> Clone the repository:
bash
" git clone <repository_url> "

--> Install dependencies:

" pip install tkinter pynput "

# Running the Application:

--> Navigate to the project directory.
--> Run the application:
" python keylogger.py "

# Using the GUI:

--> Click Start to initiate keylogging.
--> Click Stop to terminate keylogging and save the log files.

# Ethical Considerations:

--> Use this tool responsibly and legally.
--> Respect privacy and data protection laws.
--> Ensure consent when monitoring keystrokes.
